	config.guess: x86_64-pc-solaris2.11 is not properly recognized.
	config.guess guesses Solaris 11 to run on a 32-bit platform
	despite Solaris 11 no longer supporting any 32-bit platform.

	See the following code at lines 434 to 445:

	| SUN_ARCH=i386
	| # If there is a compiler, see if it is configured for 64-bit objects.
	| # Note that the Sun cc does not turn __LP64__ into 1 like gcc does.
	| # This test works for both compilers.
	| if test "$CC_FOR_BUILD" != no_compiler_found; then
	|     if (echo '#ifdef __amd64'; echo IS_64BIT_ARCH; echo '#endif') | \
	|         (CCOPTS="" $CC_FOR_BUILD -E - 2>/dev/null) | \
	|         grep IS_64BIT_ARCH >/dev/null
	|     then
	|         SUN_ARCH=x86_64
	|     fi
	| fi

	If "cc" is installed, i.e. the Oracle Studio compiler, this one is
	chosen for $CC_FOR_BUILD.  This compiler, the gcc provided by Oracle
	and also gcc bootstrapped from sources on that platform with a default
	configuration will by default generate 32-bit binaries -- even on
	a 64-bit platform.  And __amd64 will not be defined for compilations
	targeting a 32-bit platform.  This is different from the corresponding
	behaviour on GNU/Linux systems where the local platform is targeted by
	default.

	Thus, as long as you do not add "-m64" or if you have a custom-built
	gcc which defaults to 64 bit, you will get 32-bit binaries on Solaris
	despite living on a 64-bit platform.

	* config.guess (i86pc:SunOS:5.*:* || i86xen:SunOS:5.*:*): Adapt the
	test by adding the "-m64" flag.  This will work properly for Solaris
	10 as well (the last Solaris release that supported x86 32-bit
	platforms).

2021-08-14  Nick Bowler  <nbowler@draconx.ca>

	config.sub: work around command assignment bug in some shells.
	When combining variable assignments with a shell command, some older
	shells (notably heirloom-sh and presumably also Solaris 10 /bin/sh)
	have a bug which causes the assignment to alter the current execution
	environment whenever the command is a shell built-in.  For example:

	  % dash -c 'x=good; x=bad echo >/dev/null; echo $x'
	  good

	  % jsh -c 'x=good; x=bad echo >/dev/null; echo $x'
	  bad

	The config.sub script contains a few commands of the form:

	  IFS=- read ...

	which triggers this bug, causing the IFS assignment to persist for the
	remainder of the script.  This can cause misbehaviour in certain cases,
	for example:

	  % jsh config.sub i386-linux-gnu
	  config.sub: test: unknown operator gnu

	  % jsh config.sub i386-gnu/linux
	  sed: can't read s|gnu/linux|gnu|: No such file or directory
	  Invalid configuration `i386-gnu/linux': OS `' not recognized

	* config.sub: Save and restore IFS explicitly to avoid shell bugs.
	* doc/config.sub.1: Regenerate.

	config.guess: manual fixups after previous automatic patch.
	The tool could not handle command substitutions that span lines, but
	fortunately there were only two such substitutions in the script.

	The test for which universe is active on Pyramid is rewritten into a
	case block because it was the only use of a command substitution as an
	argument to the test command, which would require quoting.

	* config.guess: Rewrite "if" for Pyramid systems to "case".

	config.guess: replace POSIX $( ) with classic ` ` throughout.
	The previous replacement of backticks with POSIX command substitutions
	was ill-considered and illogical: this script recognizes many archaic
	machine types that probably never had POSIX shells, therefore it needs
	to be able to run successfully under pre-POSIX shells.

	This patch was generated using the included GNU Awk program.

	* config.guess: Revert POSIX command substitutions to classic form.
	* patch-6.gawk: Store the tool that produced the automated patch.

	config.guess: manual fixup after previous automated patches.
	This patch provides the special handling for the GNU system.  As these

	This patch also cleans up other minor issues that must be addressed
	before reverting to classic command substitutions and updates
	"shellcheck" directives to account for changes in this script and the
	change in "shellcheck" towards reporting individual portability issues.

	According to the GNU Autoconf Portable Shell Programming manual,

	the argument of 'case'.

	The change is made automatically using the following command:
